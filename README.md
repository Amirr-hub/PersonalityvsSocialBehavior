# 🧠 Personality & Social Behavior Analysis (Tableau)

This Tableau project explores how personality type (extrovert vs. introvert) influences social behaviors, using data visualizations to reveal patterns in communication habits, group dynamics, and interaction preferences.

## 📌 Overview
The goal of this project was to visually analyze how introverts and extroverts differ in real-world social behavior using a structured dataset. By creating intuitive and comparative visualizations in Tableau, the project highlights how personality correlates with behaviors such as talking vs. listening, comfort in groups, and initiation of conversations.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Extroverts** tend to talk more, initiate conversations more frequently, and are more comfortable in group settings.
- **Introverts** show higher tendencies to listen, prefer smaller groups or solitude, and may engage less frequently in initiating social interactions.
- Clear distinctions were observed in **behavioral patterns**, helping validate common psychological profiles with data-backed visuals.
- These insights can be valuable in **team composition, communication strategies,** and **user behavior research**.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Tableau (Data visualization)
- Excel (Data preprocessing)

## 💡 Future Directions
Further analysis could explore:
- Gender-based or age-based breakdowns
- Temporal behavior trends (e.g., time of day)
- Applications in workplace dynamics or educational settings
